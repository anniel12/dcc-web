    <!--DESCRIPTION OF FAIR/CLUB-->
    <section>
      <h2 class="about">ABOUT</h2>

      <p>
        The UC Davis Design Career Fair is an annual event aimed to provide students with career resources. We hope to inspire our designers to learn from different companies and guest speakers. The Design Career Fair ultimately wants to help students network with a variety of people and find job/internship opportunities.
      </p>

      <p>
        Whether you’re a new UCD student or a sage super-duper-senior, the Design Careers Club is here here to help you launch your design career! We host a diverse array of workshops and events each school year to help ensure the success of UC Davis Design students — whatever that personally looks like to you! By partnering with related clubs and campus organizations we aim to demonstrate the interdisciplinary links that make design such a fantastic field and to prepare our fellow students to confidently step out into post-grad life and take the risks they need to achieve their dreams.
